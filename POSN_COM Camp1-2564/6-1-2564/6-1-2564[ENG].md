## Barcode (10 points)

A barcode is a data code that can be read by a barcode scanner and converted into meaningful information.  
There are many types of barcodes. One commonly used format is the 13-digit barcode.

The 13-digit barcode consists of:
- The first 3 digits: country code  
- The next 4 digits: manufacturer code  
- The next 5 digits: product code  
- The last digit: check digit  

To verify a barcode, process the digits as follows, starting from the rightmost digit as position 1:

- Add all digits in even positions and multiply the sum by 3  
  (0 + 9 + 5 + 1 + 4 + 8) = 27 × 3 = 81  

- Add all digits in odd positions, starting from position 3  
  (0 + 9 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0) = 11  

- Add both results  
  81 + 11 = 92  

- The check digit must be a number that, when added to the total sum,  
  makes the result divisible by 10  

  Therefore, the check digit must be 8  
  because 92 + 8 = 100, which is divisible by 10

Write a program that reads a 13-digit barcode and checks whether it is valid.
