## Sum of Integers

The sum of integers is obtained by adding all numbers together.  
For example, the sum of integers from 1 to 10 is  
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10, which equals 55.

If the problem asks for the sum of integers from **n** to **m**,  
where **n = 1** and **m = 10**, the result is also 55.

If the problem asks for the sum of integers from **n** to **m**  
that are divisible by 3, the numbers are 3, 6, and 9,  
and their sum is 18.

If the problem asks for the sum of integers from **n** to **m**  
that are divisible by 2 or 3, the numbers are  
2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9,  
and the sum is 32.

Write a program to calculate the sum of integers between **n** and **m**  
that are divisible by 2 or 3.
