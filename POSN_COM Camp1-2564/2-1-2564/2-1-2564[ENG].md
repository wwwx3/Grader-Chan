## Sequence

A sequence of integers starts with the first two values equal to 1.  
Each following value is the sum of the two previous values.

Therefore:
- The third value is 2  
- The fourth value is 3  
- The fifth value is 5  

The sequence can be written as:

1  1  2  3  5  8  13  21  34  …

Write a program to find the value at position **n** in this sequence,  
where **n** is an integer not greater than 100 given as input.

### Input  
- One line containing an integer **n** \((n ≤ 100)\)

---

### Output  
- One line displaying the value at position **n** of the sequence
